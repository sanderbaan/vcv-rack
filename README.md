# Stellare Modular modules for VCV Rack
Modules for VCV Rack

Music Thing Turing Machine

The Turing Machine module is based on the amazing Music Thing's Turing Machine Eurorack module by Tom Whitwell. We recreated the modules based on the original schematics of the Mk2 version. Besides the main module we also created the two Mk2 expanders: Volts and 
Pulses.
